Connor:  Ok so I found that seperating the recorded and processer into 2 seperate files if better than having them into 1, 
  so the thing can constantly record and process at the same time.

  Also, we need a rasberry pi to run the code so its portable and we can bring it to school to epic prank ricky

  Before we buy, we need to research a little cuz idk if a rasberry pi is able to:
  1. import modules, specifically the ones we have
  2. save files to itself, ie our wav files
  3. run multiple python scripts
  4. activate a storm alarm and hold a mircrophone

  I've also never used a rasberry pi before so Im scared that I will dump 20 bucks into it and its useless or something idk

  Also I really want a rasberry pi

Lev:  ive got Pi 3 B with all the code set up
  We just need to meet up over spring break and code. Ill do a shit ton of reasearch and look at existing stuff. Ill try and rig up a       camera too.
